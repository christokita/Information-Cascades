# Information Cascade Model 
Exploring the role of correlation between information sources (e.g., news media outlets) in altering the organziation of societies. 

## Overview
forthecoming

Most of this project is written in Python. Python scripts are used to construct the model, simulate the model, and analyze model outputs. R is used exclusively for plotting purposes, because I feel that ggplot2 is still an unmatched plotting package when compared to alternatives in Python.

## Necessary packages for this model
All packages for this model can be installed by running script [*forthecoming feature*]. The packages that will be necessary to simulate this model and generate model outputs are:

* **Python**: numpy, pandas, dplython, igraph, scipy, re, copy, os
* **R**: dplyr, ggplot2

## Components of this repository
* **model**: this folder containt all the scripts, data, and output of the cascade model.
* **empirical**: this folder contains all the scirpts, data, and output of the analysis of Twitter data.
